  Tuglow is an exciting caving area with beautiful camping beside the Kowmung River. Undoubtedly best streamway cave in NSW, with a great swimming hole (fantastic in summer!), complete with platypus.

getting_there: >
  From Sydney, go west on the M4 Motorway, which becomes the Great Western Highway. Drive past Katoomba. Turn left at the Jenolan Caves turnoff and continue along this road. The Grand Arch (aptly named) is the marker that you've reached the Caves. Drive through the Arch, through the tourist area, and at the top of the small rise at the car park turn right. Continue to the top of the very steep climb on the road to Oberon. About two kilometres along the road at the top is a signposted turn on the left to Kanangra Walls. Take this turn. Continue ~19km along the Kanangra Road (dirt). On the right is a turn off signposted as the Kowmung River fire trail. Take this turn and continue along the fire trail (dirt). After about ten kilometres there is a parking area and a sign saying “4WD only”. You cannot take a 2WD car beyond this point. If you have 4WD, drive down the steep fire trail and cross the river. To the left after the river crossing is a parking area for the campground.
location: 'About 4hrs from Sydney and 45minutes from Jenolan Caves. A 4WD is recommended to reach the campsites by the Tuglow River and to get closer to the Tuglow Cave entrance.'
conditions_underground: 'Tuglow is mostly walk-through passage with some abseiling/ascending or laddering, clambering and some deep wades. Most trips visit the wet section of the cave where a wetsuit is required to stay warm.'
facilities: 'There are no facilities at Tuglow. There is a river but it is not a reliable source of drinking water.'
costs: 'Petrol money ~$20 return.'
what_to_bring: 'All Caving Gear, all Camping Gear, vertical gear (if abseiling), plus a wetsuit.'
