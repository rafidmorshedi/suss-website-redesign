about: 'Cooleman Caves are located within the Kosciuszko National Park in the Snowy Mountains. The majority of these caves are active rivers and it is a popular cave diving destination, but it has more than enough to satisfy non-diving cavers.'
getting_there: >
  Because this is such a long car trip, we normally organise to drive up together in a car train. The Trip Leader should let you know about driving arrangements when you sign up.
location: 'Cooleman Plains is in the Kosciuszko National Park which is about a 6-8 hour drive from Sydney.'
conditions_underground: 'These caves are mostly wet and very cold. Thermals and long wetsuits are recommended for most trips. Neoprene socks, warm gloves and a balaclava are be recommended for longer trips.'
facilities: 'There are campsites with pit toilets but you will be required to provide everything else. You must bring your own water or water purifying tablets if you wish to drink from the river.'
costs: >
  Petrol money ~$30-40 return


  Because of the distance, car pooling is recommended and can be arranged by your Trip Leader.
