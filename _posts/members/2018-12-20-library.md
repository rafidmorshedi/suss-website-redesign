The difference between adventure and exploration is how much data you bring back. We are explorers.  
  
The Sydney University Speleological Society Library and Archives are vast. We have now merged our collection with the Australian Speleological Federation Library/Museum as a major holding library. Welcome to the combined online catalogue. Feel free to browse the collections and download our non-sensitive material.  
  
If you are unable to locate your item of interest, would like to donate material such as books, journals and papers to the library or old caving equipment etc. to the museum section please contact the SUSS Librarian at:
