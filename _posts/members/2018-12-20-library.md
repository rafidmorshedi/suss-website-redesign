Welcome to the online catalogue for the Sydney University Speleological Society Library. Feel free to browse our collections and download our non-sensitive publications.

The library is for those interested in caving, speleology or just tales of epic exploration. It is available to all regardless of whether you are a SUSS member, ASF member, UIS member or just a member of the public interested in dark spaces.

We are in the process of digitising and cataloguing our collections and items will continually be added.

If you would like to contribute to the digitisation project please send an email to:
