Caving is a great way to meet new people and try something different. Also called spelunking, speleology or potholing; caving involves exploring underground passages, caverns and shafts. It can involve walking, climbing and crawling in a variety of caves, some dry, some wet, some dusty, some muddy, some warm and some cold. Some caves have beautiful features and others are more sporty. Luckily SUSS runs trips to all these kind of caves.

## What does an average trip look like?

### Friday Evening

Head to the caving area, picking up groceries and dinner on the way. If you are getting a ride from another SUSS member they will likely pick you up from a convenient train station. When you arrive, set up your tent or claim a bunk if you are at Jenolan. The rest of the evening is usually spent getting to know others on the trip.

### Saturday

Breakfast is followed by a discussion with the trip leaders as to what caves we will be visiting and allocating groups. If it is your first caving trip then the trip leader will let you know which group you will join, which ensures you are in a group appropriate to your ability and experience. Once you have been on a few trips you will have more choice as to which caves you would like to explore.

After being assigned to a group it is time to gear up for the day including packing your lunch. Your trip leader will check you have packed everything you need for the day.

We tend to set off to the caves around 9.30am and will be underground for between 4 and 8 hours so make sure your lunch is suitable for eating in a cave.

After an exciting day in the caves it is back to the campsite/hut for dinner and depending on the campsite, a shower.
​
### Sunday

Breakfast, then decide on groups for the day and gear up including lunch. Leaving for the caves around 9am, we tend to get back to the campsite/hut around 4pm to pack up or clean the hut then head home.

## What to pack

### Mandatory
