## * Why become a member
​
Club members have priority on registering for trips, if a trip fills up, non members will be asked to join or forfeit their place. If you have been or intend to come on multiple trips and live in Sydney it is reasonable to expect you to join. We charge $30 per trip for non-members, this can go towards full membership in that calendar year if you decide to do so later (so keep your receipts!).
