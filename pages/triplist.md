All trips are suitable for beginners, unless otherwise stated.  It is YOUR responsibility to inform the trip supervisor of any relevant medical
conditions which may in any way affect your fitness, such as diabetes,
asthma and the like. There will usually be costs involved when going on any trip. Check the <a href="/assets/handbook.pdf">Beginner's Handbook</a>
for information on the expected costs, for area-specific information, and general info about caving. Alternatively, ask the trip coordinator or your driver
if you still have doubts about how much a trip will cost you.

**PLEASE NOTE:**
If you would like to join a trip, please get in touch with the trip leader and let them know 2 weeks prior to the trip (you may be able to sign up closer to the time but this is dependent on numbers):

-   Your previous experience with caving (if none, that's okay!)
-   What suburb you are leaving from and if you require a ride or can provide one for others
-   If you need to borrow SUSS gear. Things you'll need for the trips that can be borrowed from SUSS include:
    -   helmets
    -   head torches (bring your own batteries - 8 x AA)
    -   overalls
    -   tents
- No pets on trips

For more information, please read through our [Beginners Handbook](/assets/handbook.pdf).
