All trips are suitable for beginners, unless otherwise stated.  It is YOUR responsibility to inform the trip supervisor of any relevant medical
conditions which may in any way affect your fitness, such as diabetes,
asthma and the like. There will usually be costs involved when going on any trip. Check the <a href="/assets/handbook.pdf">Beginner's Handbook</a>
for information on the expected costs, for area-specific information, and general info about caving. Alternatively, ask the trip coordinator or your driver
if you still have doubts about how much a trip will cost you.

**PLEASE NOTE:**
If you would like to join a trip, please get in touch with the trip leader and let them know 2 weeks prior to the trip (you may be able to sign up closer to the time but this is dependent on numbers):

-   Your previous experience with caving (if none, that's okay!)
-   What suburb you are leaving from and if you require a ride or can provide one for others
-   If you need to borrow SUSS gear. Things you'll need for the trips that can be borrowed from SUSS include:
    -   helmets
    -   head torches (bring your own batteries - 8 x AA)
    -   overalls
    -   tents

For more information, please read through our [Beginners Handbook](/assets/handbook.pdf).

Start time is 5:30pm onwards.  
If you have a portable stove top or similar cooking device, please bring it just in case.  
Bring Swimmers if you want to go into the sea. Bring frisbees, balls, etc. to throw/kick around if you wish.

There are also toilets at this park. Hereâ€™s the location: https://goo.gl/maps/ngfdaGMrxNgRxoNL9  

For both activities, note there is a train station at Stanwell Park, but trains are not particularly frequent. If you are arriving or leaving by train, both the cliff track and the park are within walking distance of the station but you might wish your fitness were better for the short and steep hike up to the cliff top!  

Rowena will bring copies of her long-awaited book, The Caves of Jenolan 3: The Southern Limestone. $20.
