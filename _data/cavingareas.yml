- name: Jenolan
  about: >
    There are many great reasons to visit Jenolan Caves. The cottage, the nearby tourist caves and range of activities available mean that it is a great place for beginners. Also, it's relatively close to Sydney. SUSS visits Jenolan at least once a month. It's almost a second home to many of us, and is the location of most of our projects. There is a great range of trips possible; some are quite challenging while others are quite easy, so it is a great destination for beginners and repeat trips!
  getting_there: >
    Jenolan caves are about 2½-3½ hours west of Sydney in the Blue Mountains, near Oberon​​​​.​​


    From Sydney, go west on the M4 Motorway, which becomes the Great Western Highway. Drive past Katoomba. Turn left at the Jenolan Caves turnoff and continue along this road.


    The Grand Arch (aptly named) is the marker that you've reached the Caves. Drive through the Arch, through the tourist area, and at the top of the small rise at the car park turn right.


    Drive up this road for a few bends, and there will be a road coming off it going uphill and to the right. It has a discreet road sign that says 'Fire Brigade'. It should take you past a few cottages.


    The Caver's Hut is clearly indicated up another incline to your left. This is quite a steep, rough dirt track, so if you have a car with low clearance, you might like to park on the side of the road at the bottom of the drive way.


    Parking at the top of the hill at the cottage is very limited, so if you do make it to the top, make sure you try to park in a way that leaves as much space as possible for other cars.
  location: >
    Cavers cottage is, next to the Jenolan show caves.
  conditions_underground: >
    Jenolan tends to be one of the colder (12-16 degrees) and often wetter caving areas. You will need thermals as well as shoes that can handle the slippery and muddy conditions. Many members prefer gumboots to Dunlop Volleys or sandshoes for their trips here. Many of the caves at Jenolan are quite wet and muddy, particularly where we go!
  facilities: >
    We are blessed to have a dedicated Caver’s Cottage at Jenolan with 240V power, stove, fridge, toaster, kettle, microwave, hot shower, flush toilet, running water, bunk beds with some mattresses and plenty of cooking utensils, plates and cutlery. There is a hose and bench just outside the cottage that you can use to clean your caving gear as well – very handy for week-long trips!


    The nearest supermarket is the Coles in Katoomba which is open until midnight on Friday nights. If you are being driven up by someone else check with them as to whether they plan on shopping on the way (ideally before the day you drive up). There is some food available at Caves House in the tourist area, but this is expensive and can be inconvenient to access.
  costs: 'Hut fees ~$8 per person / weekend, $4 per person / weekday regardless of whether you sleep in the cottage, garage or your car.


  Petrol money ~$15-20 return.'
  what_to_bring: >
    All of your Caving Gear PLUS a towel for the shower. You should bring warm gear for outside the caves as it can get quite cool late in the day, even during summer. A roll mat can be a good idea on busier trips if all the mattresses are being used.

- name: Wombeyan
  about: 'A lesser-known tourist area, Wombeyan also has a number of interesting wild caves. There are excellent formations in many of the caves. We camp in the reserve where there are lots of facilities. Much of our time at Wombeyan is spent working on projects, so if you go on a trip you can expect to be given some job to do. A few of the caves require vertical work but are usually done using ladders, so anyone can take part - ask the Trip Leader.'
  getting_there: 'Take the Hume Highway towards Canberra. There are two routes from here. The most commonly driven and quicker way to the caves is to take the turn off at Mittagong and follow the signs to Wombeyan Caves Rd. This will take about 2.5hrs from Sydney however the last section along Wombeyan Caves Rd is a very windy dirt road that may not agree with very low city cars. The other option is to drive to Goulburn and then via Taralga, which is sealed most of the way. However this will take about 3hrs. We have a corner of the camping ground that we normally occupy **on the other side of the creek closest to the old tennis courts.**'
  location: 'About a 3-3.5 hour drive south of Sydney. Access is through Mittagong and along a spectacular winding road through the Wollondilly River Valley.'
  conditions_underground: 'Some of the caves involve wading in cool water (up to chest deep!) but wetsuits are not required. Upper levels can be rather warm, dry and dusty; however thermals are required for all trips as you can cool down rapidly in these caves, particularly when working on projects.'
  facilities: 'Camping ground with hot showers, flush toilets, running water. There is a kitchen with a hot water urn, toaster and pay BBQ plates, as well as a fridge and freezer. There is sometimes a microwave but do not rely on this. Most cavers cook on the campsite fire.'
  costs: 'Petrol money ~$20 return. SUSS members assisting with projects get free camping, otherwise it is $5 per person per night'
  what_to_bring: 'All the Caving Gear PLUS Camping Gear including a camp chair.'

- name: Tuglow
  about: 'Tuglow is an exciting caving area with beautiful camping beside the Cowmung River. The best streamway cave in NSW is to be found here, and there is a great swimming hole (fantastic in summer!), complete with platypus. It is located within the Kanangra Boyd National Park.'
  getting_there: >
    From Sydney, go west on the M4 Motorway, which becomes the Great Western Highway. Drive past Katoomba. Turn left at the Jenolan Caves turnoff and continue along this road. The Grand Arch (aptly named) is the marker that you've reached the Caves. Drive through the Arch, through the tourist area, and at the top of the small rise at the car park turn right. Continue to the top of the very steep climb on the road to Oberon. About two kilometres along the road at the top is a signposted turn on the left to Kanangra Walls. Take this turn. Continue ~19km along the Kanangra Road (dirt). On the right is a turn off signposted as the Kowmung River fire trail. Take this turn and continue along the fire trail (dirt). After about ten kilometres there is a parking area and a sign saying “4WD only”. You cannot take a 2WD car beyond this point. If you have 4WD, drive down the steep fire trail and cross the river. To the left after the river crossing is a parking area for the campground.
  location: 'About 4hrs from Sydney and 45minutes from Jenolan Caves. A 4WD is recommended to reach the campsites by the Tuglow River and to get closer to the Tuglow Cave entrance.'
  conditions_underground: 'Tuglow is mostly walk-through passage with some abseiling/ascending or laddering, clambering and some deep wades. Most trips visit the wet section of the cave where a wetsuit is required to stay warm.'
  facilities: 'There are no facilities at Tuglow. There is a river but it is not a reliable source of drinking water.'
  costs: 'Petrol money ~$20 return.'
  what_to_bring: 'All Caving Gear, all Camping Gear, vertical gear (if abseiling), plus a wetsuit.'

- name: Yarrangobilly (‘Yagby’)
  about: >
    For many, there is no argument; Yarrangobilly is the best caving area in NSW. So why don't we go there more than once or twice a year? Because it's so far away! Usually the site of holiday or long weekend trips, 'Yagby' is full of large, well-decorated caves, and has heaps of potential for finding new things. It's also in a beautiful setting, with a magnificent limestone gorge and a thermal pool.
  getting_there: >
    Follow the M5 towards Melbourne. Take the turn-off for Tumut and drive along the Snowy Mountains Highway south, following the signs to Yarrangobilly. The campground is by Cotteril’s Cottage which is on the right hand side of the road just after a bridge over a creek. It is a couple of kilometres before the turnoff for Yarrangobilly Caves House, so if you see a sign for the Caves House you’ve gone too far.


    We generally camp near the cottage.
  location: >
    On the Snowy Mountains Highway in Kosciuszko National Park past Tumut, about a 6-8 hour drive southwest from Sydney.
  conditions_underground: >
    COLD!!! Some of the caves have been known to sport ice formations in winter. The lower section of Eagles Nest is particularly notorious for being around 5 degrees Celsius. Thermals are definitely essential. The caves can get quite muddy too.
  facilities: >
    There is a basic campground with pit toilets and a streamway (not drinkable) but no other facilities. You will need to bring your own camping gear, stove, food and water.
  costs: 'Petrol money ~$30-60 return.'
  what_to_bring: >
    Check with your Trip Leader as facilities and trips vary.


    **LOTS OF WARM CLOTHES.**

    - Oh, and your Caving Gear.

    - All food and water (there are no stores nearby).

    - You may need all camping gear. If you are going in colder months (basically, any time except summer – we have seen heavy snow in April and October) you should make sure your sleeping gear in particular is warm.

    - Some of the caves are quite pretty and require you to remove your outer clothing before entering some areas. If it a good idea to have a spare pair of clean-soled sandshoes/ Volleys for these sections.

    - Lastly, don't forget your swimming gear – a daily swim in the thermal pool (and the very un-thermal river for some) has become a SUSS tradition.

- name: Cooleman Caves
  about: 'Cooleman Caves are located within the Kosciuszko National Park in the Snowy Mountains. The majority of these caves are active rivers and it is a popular cave diving destination, but it has more than enough to satisfy non-diving cavers.'
  getting_there: >
    Because this is such a long car trip, we normally organise to drive up together in a car train. The Trip Leader should let you know about driving arrangements when you sign up.
  location: 'Cooleman Plains is in the Kosciuszko National Park which is about a 6-8 hour drive from Sydney.'
  conditions_underground: 'These caves are mostly wet and very cold. Thermals and long wetsuits are recommended for most trips. Neoprene socks, warm gloves and a balaclava are be recommended for longer trips.'
  facilities: 'There are campsites with pit toilets but you will be required to provide everything else. You must bring your own water or water purifying tablets if you wish to drink from the river.'
  costs: >
    Petrol money ~$30-40 return


    Because of the distance, car pooling is recommended and can be arranged by your Trip Leader.
  what_to_bring: 'All Caving Gear and Camping Gear, a wetsuit PLUS additional warm gear, a dry bag and all food and water.'
