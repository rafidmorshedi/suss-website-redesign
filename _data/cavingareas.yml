- name:          Wombeyan
  getting_there: 'Take the Hume Highway towards Canberra. There are two routes from here. The most commonly driven and quicker way to the caves is to take the turn off at Mittagong and follow the signs to Wombeyan Caves Rd. This will take about 2.5hrs from Sydney however the last section along Wombeyan Caves Rd is a very windy dirt road that may not agree with very low city cars. The other option is to drive to Goulburn and then via Taralga, which is sealed most of the way. However this will take about 3hrs. We have a corner of the camping ground that we normally occupy on the other side of the creek closest to the old tennis courts.'
  location: 'About a 3-3.5 hour drive south of Sydney. Access is through Mittagong and along a spectacular winding road through the Wollondilly River Valley.'
  conditions_underground: 'Some of the caves involve wading in cool water (up to chest deep!) but wetsuits are not required. Upper levels can be rather warm, dry and dusty; however thermals are required for all trips as you can cool down rapidly in these caves, particularly when working on projects.'
  facilities: 'Camping ground with hot showers, flush toilets, running water. There is a kitchen with a hot water urn, toaster and pay BBQ plates, as well as a fridge and freezer. There is sometimes a microwave but do not rely on this. Most cavers cook on the campsite fire.'
  costs: 'Petrol money ~$20 return. SUSS members assisting with projects get free camping, otherwise it is $5 per person per night'
  what_to_bring: 'All the Caving Gear PLUS Camping Gear including a camp chair.'
